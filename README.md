# Polargraph-machine
This project simulates a software image to paint it on any surface (with any width and Height) using electric motors that generates discrete angular movement to move the wires that are attached with the pen and draw an image we wanted to simulate.
The purpose of the polar drawing machine is that it could be used in education purposes and art schools in assisting the teachers by demonstrating any image, while the most important purpose of the project is that we can draw any image that we want on any surface with various dimensions.

# Our steps of the project:
1. for the body we start to searching for the body that will contain the components and we find a design that we 3d printing here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2371117/files and we used plastic for that
2. for the components we used several components for that:
    - Arduino MEGA.
    - L293D Motor Drive Shield
    - L293D Motor Drive IC
    - 17 Stepper Motor
    - Servo Motor MG90S
    - GT2 Pulley 16 Teeth set
    - 5M GT2 Rubber belt
    - Power Supply (12v)
    - Adapter 5V/3.5A
3. for software we used a software called "processing" for that here the link : https://processing.org and thanks for euphy we used his code for the motors and servo controllers the package is here : https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/releases/tag/2017-11-01-20-30
4. for the wiring we desing a scematic for that here : and we start by connecting and motor and servo to the motor drive and attach it to the arduino and hange the motor with rubber built.

# Polargraph-machine
This project simulates a software image to paint it on any surface (with any width and Height) using electric motors that generates discrete angular movement to move the wires that are attached with the pen and draw an image we wanted to simulate.
The purpose of the project is being used in schools as if a robot arm to paint a certain design.
